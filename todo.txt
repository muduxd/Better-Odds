BetTer Odds

Hi!
Can you make me a website for bets in a videogame so that it ensures the player
is certainly making profit in resources.
The name of the website is going to be "Better Odds" the color theme of the website is racing green and black/white with a dark theme switcher.
I want the website to have all the modern SEO additions so it should be first ranked in Google.
There should be at least two inputs for bets but the user can add more than 2 bets at a time.
For each bet the user adds the odds of that bet and the program shows for
each bet the stake the user has to add and the payout for that bet. The user also has to add the total amount of
money to be distributed around all bets. And the website should output
the stake for each bet that the user have to add in order to make a certain payout. 
Also the calculated payouts have to be the same, only the stake for the bet
to be different. If the odds
for the betts are not making any certain profit, the website should tell the user that in a message.
I also want the website to have an about page or something that displays more information
to the users in order to understand how to use the website and also allow google to place
ads on it for revenue. I want it made in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that it maximizes performance.
The design has to be modern looking and user friendly with a bit of animations.
